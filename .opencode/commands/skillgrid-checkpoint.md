You are executing **`/skillgrid-checkpoint`** for the Skillgrid workflow.

Create, verify, list, or clear named Skillgrid checkpoints.

**Status on exit:** no PRD status change.

## Shared Skillgrid Skills

Before acting, load only the skills needed for the phase:

- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-questioning/SKILL.md` — ask only blocking questions and record answers.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-codebase-map/SKILL.md` — map repo structure, graphify output, tests, and conventions.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-parallel-research/SKILL.md` — coordinate external research and long evidence capture.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-subagent-orchestration/SKILL.md` — dispatch bounded subagents with handoff paths and two-stage review.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-prd-artifacts/SKILL.md` — PRD numbering, `INDEX.md`, title blocks, and status lifecycle.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-spec-artifacts/SKILL.md` — PRD-to-OpenSpec artifacts and validation.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-vertical-slices/SKILL.md` — shippable slices, `[HITL]` / `[AFK]`, and testable increments.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-ui-design-artifacts/SKILL.md` — UI decisions, previews, `DESIGN.md`, and OpenSpec design constraints.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-issue-creation/SKILL.md` — local/GitHub/GitLab/Jira issue behavior from `.skillgrid/config.json`.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-hybrid-persistence/SKILL.md` — disk plus Engram persistence.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-filesystem-handoff/SKILL.md` — `context_<change-id>.md` and `research/<change-id>/`.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-openspec-config/SKILL.md` — `openspec/config.yaml` overlay rules.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-project-docs/SKILL.md` — `DESIGN.md` and `.skillgrid/project/*` docs.
- `.agents/skills/skillgrid-checkpoints/SKILL.md` — `.skillgrid/tasks/checkpoints.log`.


## Phase-Specific Skills

Load these first for this command:

- `skillgrid-checkpoints`
- `skillgrid-filesystem-handoff`

## Steps

1. Determine action: create, verify, list, or clear.
2. For create: record branch, SHA, dirty status, PRD, OpenSpec change, handoff, and optional verification evidence.
3. For verify: compare current state with the recorded checkpoint and report drift without reverting.
4. For list: show checkpoint names and active change links.
5. For clear: remove only matching checkpoint entries, never unrelated change state.

## Completion Report

Report checkpoint action, affected entries, drift or evidence, and next recommended command.
