## SDD Core Workflow

### `/sdd-init`

**Phase:** Setup (run once per project)

**What it does:** Detects project stack, conventions, and testing capabilities. Bootstraps the active persistence backend (engram, openspec, hybrid, or none). Creates `.skillgrid/` and `openspec/` directory structures. Builds the skill registry. Refreshes semantic indexes.

**Skills used:** `sdd-init`, `skillgrid-skill-registry`, `ccc`, `gitnexus-cli`, `openspec-onboard`

**Input:** None (auto-detects project)

**Output artifacts:**
- `.skillgrid/config.json`
- `.skillgrid/project/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.skillgrid/project/PROJECT.md`
- `.skillgrid/project/STRUCTURE.md`
- `.skillgrid/project/SKILL_REGISTRY.md`
- `openspec/config.yaml`
- `openspec/specs/`
- `openspec/changes/`

---

### `/sdd-brainstorm <change-name>`

**Phase:** Planning (start of every new change)

**What it does:** Orchestrates the full planning pipeline. Delegates to sub-agents for each phase in sequence. Integrates UI design sub-flow and optional Beads sync.

**Skills used (sequential pipeline):**

| Step | Skill | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `sdd-explore` | Codebase investigation, approach comparison |
| 2 | `sdd-clarify` | Interactive questioning, CONTEXT.md updates |
| 3 | `sdd-propose` | `proposal.md` — intent, scope, approach, rollback plan |
| 4 | `sdd-spec` | `specs/<domain>/spec.md` — delta specs with Given/When/Then |
| 5 | `sdd-design` | `design.md` — architecture decisions, data flow, file changes |
| 6 | `sdd-adr` (conditional) | ADRs in `.skillgrid/adr/` if architectural decisions needed |
| 7 | `sdd-design-ui` (conditional) | UI design artifacts if user-facing scope |
| 8 | `sdd-prd` | `.skillgrid/prd/PRD<NN>_<slug>.md` — product requirements |
| 9 | `sdd-tasks` | `tasks.md` — implementation checklist with HITL/AFK labels |
| 10 | `beads-sync` (conditional) | Beads epic + issues if `beads_enable: true` |

**Input:** Change name (kebab-case)

**Output artifacts:**
- `openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md`
- `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/<domain>/spec.md`
- `openspec/changes/<name>/design.md`
- `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`
- `.skillgrid/prd/PRD<NN>_<name>.md`
- Optional: ADRs, Beads epic/issues, UI previews

---

### `/sdd-explore <topic>`

**Phase:** Planning (standalone investigation)

**What it does:** Free-form exploration of a topic or feature idea. Reads codebase, compares approaches, provides recommendation. Makes NO code changes.

**Skills used:** `sdd-explore`, `parallel-delegate`, `exa-search`

**Input:** Topic to explore

**Output:** Exploration findings (engram topic or `exploration.md`)

---

### `/sdd-clarify <change-name>`

**Phase:** Planning (interactive questioning)

**What it does:** Challenges the plan against the existing domain model. Sharpens terminology, resolves ambiguity, updates `.skillgrid/project/CONTEXT.md`.

**Skills used:** `sdd-clarify`

**Input:** Change name

**Output:** Updated `CONTEXT.md`, clarified terminology

---

### `/sdd-apply [change-name]`

**Phase:** Implementation

**What it does:** Orchestrates the full implementation pipeline:
1. Workspace isolation (creates git worktree)
2. Plan validation (ensures tasks are granular and TDD-compliant)
3. Sequential agent execution (dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review)
4. Evidence collection (TDD logs, spec compliance, quality review per task)

Follows enforced TDD protocol automatically. No human checkpoints between tasks unless blocked.

**Skills used:** `sdd-apply` (orchestrator), `isolated-workspace`, `granular-planning`, `sequential-agent-executor`, `enforced-tdd-protocol`

**Input:** Optional change name (picks active change if omitted)

**Preflight gate:**
1. Task label validation (`.skillgrid/scripts/validate-task-labels.sh`)
2. Artifacts present (tasks.md, specs/, design.md)
3. TDD compliance check (if TDD enabled)

**Output:** Implemented code, passing tests, updated `tasks.md` with `[x]` marks, per-task evidence in `.agents/tasks/<change-id>/`

**Execution modes:**
- Default: `sequential-agent-executor` (fresh subagent per task, two-stage review)
- Alternative: `batch-executor` (checkpointed batches, manual review between)

---

### `/sdd-loop [change-name]`

**Phase:** Implementation (controlled continuation)

**What it does:** Picks one AFK-safe slice per iteration, executes it through the full pipeline (workspace → plan → apply → verify locally), captures verification evidence, then reassesses risk. Stops deterministically on gate failures. Safer for long-running sessions where context might be lost.

**Skills used:** `sdd-apply` (delegated per slice), `sdd-verify` (local check), `sdd-persona-board` (escalation on risk)

**Input:** Optional change name

**Output artifacts:**
- Updated `.skillgrid/tasks/context_<change-id>.md`
- Event log `.skillgrid/tasks/events/<change-id>.jsonl`
- Slice verification reports

---

### `/sdd-verify [change-name]`

**Phase:** Verification — Stage 1 (Spec Compliance)

**What it does:** Validates that implementation fully satisfies the slice specification. Builds traceability matrix: every requirement → concrete evidence (code/test file:line). Does NOT review code quality — that's `sdd-review`.

**Skills used:** `sdd-verify` (orchestrator), `spec-compliance-verifier` (core logic)

**Process:**
1. Read all slice specs for the change
2. For each slice: parse requirements, gather evidence from codebase
3. Build traceability table (requirement → evidence location)
4. Determine verdict: **PASS** (all satisfied) / **FAIL** (missing requirements) / **PARTIAL** (incomplete)
5. Save report: `openspec/changes/<id>/verification/<slice>-report.md`

**Verdict meanings:**
- **PASS** → proceed to `sdd-review`
- **FAIL** → fix missing requirements via `sdd-apply`, then re-run
- **PARTIAL** → treat as needing work (some requirements incomplete)

**Gate:** `sdd-archive` checks `.skillgrid/state/verification_status = passed` — requires PASS to proceed.

---

### `/sdd-review [change-name]`

**Phase:** Verification — Stage 2 (Code Quality)

**What it does:** Reviews implementation for code health independent of spec compliance. Evaluates readability, DRY, error handling, test quality, security, performance, maintainability. Produces severity-tagged issues (CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/MINOR) and APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUESTED verdict.

**Skills used:** `sdd-review` (orchestrator), `code-quality-reviewer` (core logic)

**Process:**
1. Confirm `sdd-verify` passed (pre-check)
2. Invoke `code-quality-reviewer` on changed files
3. Categorize issues by severity
4. Provide concrete fixes for each issue
5. Verdict: **APPROVED** (zero CRITICAL, zero or resolved IMPORTANT) or **CHANGES_REQUESTED**

**Review loop:** If issues found → implementer fixes → re-run `sdd-review --re-review` until APPROVED.

**Flags:**
- `--slice <slug>` — review specific slice only
- `--re-review` — focus on previously flagged items
- `--reviewer <persona>` — delegate review to persona (e.g., `thor`, `heimdall`)
- `--force` — skip already-reviewed check

**Gate:** `sdd-archive` requires APPROVED review report present.

---

### `/sdd-archive [change-name]`

**Phase:** Archiving (after both verification gates pass)

**What it does:** Three-gate precheck before archiving:
1. **Spec compliance** (`sdd-verify` passed)
2. **Code quality** (`sdd-review` approved)
3. **Pre-merge verification** (tests green, lint clean, worktree clean, branch mergeable, security scan)

Then executes user-chosen disposition: merge to main / open PR / keep branch / discard. Cleans up workspace if `isolated-workspace` was used.

**Skills used:** `sdd-archive` (orchestrator), `pre-merge-verification` (gate), `isolated-workspace` (cleanup)

**Input:** Optional change name

**Disposition** (from config or prompt):
- `merge` — merge branch to main, push
- `pr` — push branch, create PR via `gh`
- `keep` — leave branch, no merge
- `discard` — delete branch, keep local changes if any

**Post-archive:**
- Move `openspec/changes/<id>/` → `openspec/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<id>/`
- Update `.skillgrid/prd/INDEX.md` if PRD-linked (mark tasks complete)
- Clear active change state
- Remove worktree if isolated

**Gate enforcement:** If any precheck fails → `status: blocked`, `next_recommended` lists fixes. No archive until all three gates pass.

---

**Skills used:** `sdd-ui-design`, `sdd-design`, `engram-ui-elements`, `engram-visual-language`, `design-taste-frontend`, `frontend-ui-engineering`, `high-end-visual-design`, `impeccable`, `superdesign`, `huashu-design`, `image-to-code`

**Input:** Surface or change name

**Output:** UI design direction, preview artifacts (via `preview.sh`)

---

### `/sdd-gherkin <input>`

**What it does:** Drafts, reviews, or tightens Gherkin/BDD scenarios and acceptance criteria.

**Skills used:** `c4-diagrams`

**Input:** System or scope description

**Output:** ASCII or Mermaid diagrams

---

### `/sdd-diagnose <bug>`

**Phase:** Specialist (Debug)

**What it does:** Systematic debugging using 4-phase protocol:
1. **Root Cause Investigation** — gather evidence, reproduce consistently, instrument multi-component boundaries, trace data flow backward
2. **Pattern Analysis** — find working examples, compare, read references completely
3. **Hypothesis & Test** — generate 3–5 ranked falsifiable hypotheses, test minimally one variable at a time
4. **Implementation** — create failing regression test (if seam exists), apply minimal fix, verify, cleanup

**Enforcement:** NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST. Three-fixes threshold: if 3+ attempted fixes fail → STOP → question architecture → escalate to `sdd-architecture-review`.

**Skills used:** `sdd-diagnose` (orchestrator), systematic-debugging methods integrated into skill

**Input:** Bug report, test failure, unexpected behavior

**Output:** Diagnostic report with evidence, root cause, fix, verification, post-mortim. Saved to `.skillgrid/tasks/research/<issue-id>-diagnosis.md`

**Integration:** After diagnosis, optional `sdd-apply` to implement thorough fix if initial fix was minimal. If architecture friction found → `sdd-architecture-review`.

---

### `/sdd-openspec-git`

**What it does:** Enforces OpenSpec git gates — ensures proposal/apply/archive cross main branch correctly, commits are explicit. Never auto-commits or merges.

**Skills used:** `openspec-git-discipline`

**Input:** Optional context or change name

**Output:** Git facts, gate outcomes, next recommended action

---

## Persona Board Commands

The Norse persona board provides multi-perspective decision-making with hard-gate enforcement.

### `/sdd-persona-board <decision> [--preset <alias>]`

**What it does:** Runs a complete persona board cycle — defines decision scope, resolves routing preset, dispatches selected personas in parallel, merges findings, persists artifacts.
